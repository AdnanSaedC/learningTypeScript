when you write code in ts it gets into a process and then conveerted into js

ts is a superset of js
it has everything which js has with additional functionality

generating doc in js is very not good
but for ts it is best because it brings consistency to the table

typeScript does not has an engine it runs on js V8 engine
it just does two things
typeChecker
and consistency in js

when we are using typescript with node/react we have to do things diffrenetly

here we have not installed ts globally
so let's run ts compiler
npx tsc --init
node package executor tscompiler(we get this by installing in ts) initialize

after running this you will get a tsconfiguration file and ts project is initailized(started)

typeAnnotation - we specifically or explicitly defines the type
inference - type script itself gets the type on its own
